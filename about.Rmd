In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a global pandemic following the alarming levels of global spread. Forcing the closure of millions of non-essential businesses while changing what we would consider as `normal`. Thus, it is imperative that we begin planning feasible outcomes for the future, to answer the question of how we will work, live, and thrive in a post-pandemic world. 
<br />
COVID-19 has been a driving factor for changes to the `normal` environment and as a group Health_R10 has decided that Health Systems will be the general topic that we will be basing our dashboard on.
<br />

With this in mind, the aim of this project is to discover which country's response model/ rollout model was most effective and provide information on which is the most important factors that make these models to be effective.

This project is an Interdisciplinary Capstone Project - DATA3888 created by Jiansong Zhao, Jielin Feng, Jeremy Tan, Rhuten Yeole, Vinh Quang Hoang and Xingwei Zhou. Various data Sources are `hyperlinked` over the course of the **About** page.

## Global Statistics

The **main components** of the analysis are:

- **Insert Sources**

The data used in this project can be obtained from the following Sources; 

- **Insert Sources**

## Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)

The **main components** of the analysis are:

- Placeholder 1
- Placeholder 2

Data from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) is collected by [Blavatnik School of Government](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker). OxCGRT collects the data regarding what measures various governments have taken during which (time) period in order to aid efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The data used in this project can be obtained from [github.com](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker)

## Our World In Data (OWID) COVID-19 Testing

The **main components** of the analysis are:

- Placeholder 1
- Placeholder 2

For testing, we drew from three (3) various data sources to perform our analysis. First, [Testing Policies](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-testing-policy) where OWID used a specific dataset from [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker). The data here is a subset of the one used in **Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)**. Next, [OWID]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) reproduced a dataset which included various areas of general COVID-19 information. This dataset contained features relating to COVID-19 tests. The last data set used can be from from [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-19-tests-smoothed-7-day?time=2020-04-09..latest&country=~MYS). Where the time series data was smoothed by averaging daily figures over a rolling 7 - day window. 

## Our World In Data (OWID) COVID-19 Vaccinations

The **main components** of the analysis are:

- Placeholder 1
- Placeholder 2

The various vaccination datasets used were provided by [OWID](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) while additional datasets used contained continent related information to aid the categorization of continents also hosted by [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/continents-according-to-our-world-in-data) at the respective link. In their [Github Repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations), OWID stored country-by-country data on global vaccinations. Including information about total number of vaccinations, daily vaccinations and so on. 


## The Code

The code used to implement the shiny app and visualizations were written in **"R"**. **Documentation** and **About** pages of the Shiny Dashboard app were written and published using *R Markdown* for better flexibility.
